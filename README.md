# Chat_Application
# Beginner-Friendly Python Chat Application

This project is a very simple *client-server chat application* created using Python’s built-in socket module.  
It is made using easy and beginner-level code and is part of my learning experience under the *Oasis Infobyte Internship*.

---

## 📁 Project Files
- *server.py* – Starts the server, waits for a client, receives messages, and sends replies.
- *client.py* – Connects to the server, sends messages, and receives responses.

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The server waits for a connection.  
2. The client connects to the server.  
3. Both can send messages to each other.  
4. Typing *exit* on any side closes the chat safely.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- *Python*
- *Socket Programming (TCP)*
- Simple loops and conditions
- Basic networking concepts

## ▶️ How to Run

### 1️⃣ Start the server
```bash
python server.py

2️⃣ Start the client (in another terminal)

python client.py

3️⃣ Start chatting!

Type messages and press Enter.

To end the chat:
